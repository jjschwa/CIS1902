# HW1 - Pythonic Programming
Due Date:

This homework is designed to get you warmed up and familiar with Python syntax and pythonic thinking as well as unit testing. The problems will ramp up in difficulty as you go through the file. 

Please refer to the instructions in the file to fill out each function definition. 

Additionally, you will be submitting a test file called `HW1_test.py` that you make from scratch. In this file, you will use the unittest library to write unit tests for *5 different functions*. 

## Starter File

You need to download the starter file for `HW1.py` [here](../HW1.py). 

## Submission

You should submit to gradescope a file called `HW1.py` **and** `HW1_test.py`. If the file names aren't exact then the autograder won't run.
