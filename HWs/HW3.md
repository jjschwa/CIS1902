# HW3 - Predicting NYC Property Values Part 1
Due Date: 

[nyc-property-sales.csv](../HWs/nyc-property-sales.csv)

[nyc_properties.ipynb](../HWs/hw3.ipynb)

This dataset was taken from Kaggle.

In this assignment, we’ll be working with a dataset of property sales within New York City boroughs from a 12-month period, roughly 2016-2017. This assignment has two parts:

First, we’ll first clean the data and then answer some questions that will provide us with insight to formulate a predictive model for property prices.
We’ll then use the insights from above to create a linear regression model to predict prices.
Attached you will find the dataset of NYC property sales (nyc-property-sales.csv). Information about the columns are described in the table below. Additionally, you will find a starter Python Notebook (nyc_properties.ipynb) with cells that have questions you should determine the answers to. Submit your completed notebook on Canvas.
