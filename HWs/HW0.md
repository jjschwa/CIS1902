# HW0 - Getting to Know You and Set Up
Due Date:

Welcome to CIS 1902! First things first, I want to get to know you a little bit better. Please fill out [this required combined introductions and syllabus/schedule quiz form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAEd1avQ8mJavQJtqddr5s-lrJ39xy6JcxYF3nfuXF-MDHsQ/viewform?usp=dialog)

Second, your homework goal for this week is to set up your python environment and make sure it’s working. You will also get used to using Gradescope to submit assignments. 

## Installing Python

If you already have python installed, you can check your version by navigating to a terminal and doing `python3 –version` on MacOS and `python –version` on Windows. This course requires Python 3.11 and above. 
If you don’t have an updated version, please navigate to the python website and download an updated version. Refresh your terminal after downloading and check your version again. 

What you just downloaded is a python interpreter and will allow your computer to run python code. In addition to that, you need somewhere to write the code. 

Installing a text editor:
The recommended text editor for this course is VS Code. You can download it here.

We recommend at least disabling Github Copilot on VS Code, as it inhibits your ability to actually learn how to code in python. 
Open the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X or ⌘+Shift+X) in VSCode.
Search for GitHub Copilot
Click the ⚙️ (gear) icon next to it.
Choose Disable (keeps it installed but inactive) or Uninstall (removes it completely).
Optional: 
You can install a ruler to mark how long your lines should be following the directions here.

## Coding

Create a file from scratch, name it “helloworld.py”. Please write python code such that when the file is run in a terminal with the command `python3 helloworld.py` the phrase “Hello World” is printed exactly like that. 

## Submission

Please make sure you submit the following files with the exact right name.

`helloworld.py`
