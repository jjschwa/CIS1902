# Python

Welcome to CIS 1902: Python! We are so excited to have you here. Python is easily one of the more popular and powerful programming languages of today, from simple syntax to its power in machine learning and even web development.

This section of CIS 1902 will start with the fundamentals of Python, sliding into game development in Python. This is followed by two more modules: data science and web development. Classes are structured with a lecture sprinkled with interactivity and questions for students. At the end of the course you will build a final project of your choosing!

Some highlights of the topics covered include:

Data Analysis and Scientific Computing (pandas and numpy)
Machine Learning and Neural Nets (scikit-learn and PyTorch)
How the Web Works
Fullstack Development and REST APIs (Django & Flask)

## Prerequisites

The start of this class moves relatively quickly, assuming familiarity with the concepts of variables, functions, basic data structures, and concepts such as iteration in some programming language. We will mainly be focusing on syntax and variations in syntax compared to other languages, such as Java. 

## Communication

We will primarily use Ed for discussion outside of lecture and office hours. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and the teaching staff. Rather than emailing, we encourage you to post your questions on Ed.

## Grading

There are 7 homework assignments and a final project. Homeworks will count for 55% of your grade, the final project will count for 35%, and attendance and participation will count for 10%. The final project checkpoint is worth 5%, the final presentation is worth 10%, and the final coding deliverable is worth 10%. Throughout the lecture students will fill out a form and submit it at the end of the lecture; this will count for attendance and participation. One unexcused absence will be granted no questions asked. Excused absences will be given for unavoidable conflicts, e.g. a job interview, illness. There will be opportunities for extra credit throughout the course!

## Assignment Deadlines and Late Submissions

All assignments are due 30 minutes prior to the start of class the day they are due. Every assignment will have a 24 hour “grace period” window, in which there is no penalty for submitting late. All assignments must be submitted to Gradescope by the end of this grace period to be considered on time. In addition to the grace period, every student gets 5 late days that they may use at any point in the semester. You may use up to 1 late day on any one assignment. Late days are automatically applied for any submission submitted after the grace period deadline. This means the latest any assignment may be submitted for full credit is 48 hours after 30 minutes prior to the start of class the day the assignment is originally due. Late days are rounded up, meaning if an assignment is submitted even one second after the original deadline, it will use a late day. Once late days are exhausted, assignments will take a 10% penalty per day it is late. 
Unfortunately, there is one exception to this policy: no late days nor grace period will apply to the final project because of the final project in class presentations. 

## Collaboration
Verbal collaboration is encouraged, especially during in-class practice problems! However, copying code, looking at another student's code, reading code off verbatim, etc. is forbidden.
