The final project is really meant to be an opportunity for you to go as deep as you want on a Python project. Create anything that you want to build! You will be allowed to work in groups up to 3.

## Requirements

Given the open-ended nature of the project, these guidelines are not solid, but more for you to get a grasp of what effort we're looking for. As a rule of thumb, we're looking for something of at least the scale of the homeworks per group member. That is, if there are 3 people in a group, the project should be around the effort of 3 homeworks.

Also, if you pick something ambitious, it's totally fine to have something that's just an MVP!

* At least one class definition
* A couple of first-party packages (`collections`, `time`, `json`, etc)
* A couple of third-party packages (`django`, `pandas`, `keras`, etc)
* Well documented code, i.e. in-line comment, function docstrings
* A `README.md` with installation instructions and explanation of code

## Milestones

### Project Proposal

**Due Date:**

The first part of the first deadline will be the project proposal. Write no longer than a page about your idea and how you will attempt to accomplish it. Identify what you think will be the hardest portion of the project. What packages do you think you will need to use? What's the end goal of the project?

Feel free (in fact it might be easier) to break your information into tables or bullet points so it's clear which pieces are going into it. 

The second part will be a ~15 minute meeting with a staff member to get feedback.

Keep in mind that the earlier you submit your proposal and sign up for a meeting, the earlier I can give feedback!

### Project Presentation

**Due Date:**

Create a short presentation about your project, aim for no longer than 7-8 minutes. Your presentation should cover:

1. What your idea is/motivation
2. A roadmap of your implementation plan
3. Any challenges you ran into
4. A demo if applicable (can be a pre-recorded video)

### Code Submission

**Due Date:**

The final code will be due on the last day of classes. Alongside your code, please include a `README.md` that at least covers the following:

1. A description of your project
2. An explanation of code structure
3. Instructions to install and run the project

Zip your code and submit it on Gradescope.

## Potential Project Ideas

* **Image Classification:** this will likely require adapting an existing neural network or replicating some research papers (e.g. AlexNet). You may want to use [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides GPUs for free.
* **Data science:** find a dataset that interests you and answer some insightful questions about the dataset and train a model for it. Check out [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for free datasets.
* **Web Development:** create a website for an idea you have. Hosting it is not required.
* **Web Scraping:** write a web scraper to index and crawl the web. You may want to use something like [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read the webpages.
* **Game Development:** check out [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), a pixel game engine for Python.
